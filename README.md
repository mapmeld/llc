## LLC

I am looking into forming an LLC. Here are my main reasons:

- Applying for grants, tracking and distributing funds for international projects (education, mapping, etc). Everyone will feel better about funding and gifts when it goes to a designated account, with public data showing how it is being used.
- Potentially doing web dev and GIS consulting in the future. An LLC is essential for handling liability and taxes in the consulting business.

## Open company

I want to run this LLC as an open company. Except when prohibited by law:

- I would publish all expenses made by my LLC
- I would open source any code and hardware
- I would maintain a public@example.com address to openly publish suggestions, requests, and general feedback. I am reluctant to automatically publish, because people could put scams or proprietary information, so this would need to be human-filtered.

It'd be very unlikely that I would do any of these:

- publish income or bids, because this disrupts how others do business
- release strategic documents or chat logs, unless others agree for their words to be public

## Plans subject to change

Really important! I don't know enough about LLCs, open businesses, and legal limitations. I would appreciate your feedback!
